abstract = {The explosion of mobile applications both in number and variety raises the need of shedding light on their architecture, composition and quality. Indeed, it is crucial to understand which mobile application paradigm fits better to what type of application and usage. Such understanding has direct consequences on the user experience, the development cost and sale revenues of mobile apps. In this paper, we identified four main mobile application paradigms and evaluated them from the developer, user and service provider viewpoints. To ensure objectivity and soundness we start by defining high level criteria and then breaking down in finer-grained criteria. After a theoretical evaluation an implementation was carried out as a practical verification. The selected application is object recognition app, which is both exciting and challenging to develop.},
